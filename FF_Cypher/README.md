FOR FUN: Cypher
===============

This is an optional, UNGRADED project for practicing your growing object-oriented skills in C++.

Skills practiced:

* Inheritance
* Regression tests
* Command line or Text Menu User interface
* (Bonus) File I/O

The requirements are in ```P4_Requirements_Update_2.pdf```. Suggested solution code may be found in the subdirectories, and may be built using ```make``` and executed using ```./cypher```, ```./interactive```, or (for regression tests) ```./test```.  As always, correct solutions may vary.
