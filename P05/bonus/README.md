Bonus
=====

Remember, *you must complete the full credit assignment to get any credit for the bonus assignment!*

The bonus gives you the opportunity to write a regression test consisting of 4 separate, preferably isolated tests. Remember that a regression test prints *nothing* unless one or more errors are found, in which case provide a concise but clear error message for each and the word "FAIL" at the end.
