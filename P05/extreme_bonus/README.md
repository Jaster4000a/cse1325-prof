Bonus
=====

Remember, *you must complete the full credit and bonus assignments to get any credit for the extreme bonus assignment!*

The extreme bonus gives you the opportunity to *reduce* the amount of code in your main function using *polymorphism*. Rather than two vectors and separate calls to the various Taxed and Taxfree object methods, combine them into a single vector with the methods called polymorphically.

We'll dive deeply into polymorphism in our third and final section of this course. But why wait?  Polymorph today!
